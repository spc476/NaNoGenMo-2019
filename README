As of now, I haven't settled upon a theme, other than it probably will use
Toki Pona in some form.  Any results generated will be in the "results/"
directory.  

I should also note that the LuaXML module only works for Lua 5.1.  I updated
the code to compile cleanly on Lua 5.2 or higher, but it fails to run
properly due to quirks of the Lua 5.1 module system.  So that, and the
"getdict.lua" script will need to be run under Lua 5.1 The other Lua scripts
will run fine under any modern version of Lua.

Results so far ...

results/mama_pi_me_mute.txt

	Some 5,000 translations of the opening of the Lord's Prayer in
	Toki Pona.  The open of the Lord's Prayer goes:

		Our Father, which art in heaven

	and has been translated to Toki Pona as:

		mama pi me mute 0, sina lon sewi kon

	Just this line along has generated so many translations as to end up
	over 350,000 words.  I've just picked enough at random to fulfill
	the 50,000 word criteria.
